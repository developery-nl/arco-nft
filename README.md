## arco-nft
script to automate arcomia nft reward claim

### requirements
you need install web3 python module (tested with 6.11) and python 3.7

### usage
- you need to put the .py file and the abi text file in the same folder
- edit the py file, fill in your address and keys in the code (watch out where you use this script.. no responsibility for me)
- fill in minimum claim threshold (now set at 1000 rcm)
- (note that each individual claim will cost you some fee, this script is not a 1-button-claim-all trick ! )
- run it, stop it manually after all claims are done or let it run
