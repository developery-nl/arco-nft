## Claim arcomia nft rewards
This is a script to automate the claiming of multiple arcomia nft rewards. Its intended for nft arcomia stakers with 50 or more nft who do not like to repeat the claiming process manually n times x times per week / month

### Requirements
The python script (tested with 3.7) needs you to install web3 python module (tested with 6.11) 

### Usage
- you need to put the .py file and the abi text file in the same folder
- edit the py file, fill in your address and keys in the code (watch out where you use this script.. no responsibility for me!)
- fill in minimum claim threshold (now set at 1000 rcm)
- (note that each individual claim will cost you some fee, this script is not a 1-button-claim-all trick ! )
- run it, stop it manually after all claims are done or let it run
